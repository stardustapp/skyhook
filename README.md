# skyhook

This repository serves as a staging ground for a webhook -> notification system.
Currently, IRC is the only implemented notification target.

The de-facto deployment of this code targets the Freenode and Libera.Chat IRC networks.

As this codebase matures, it should dissolve into the Stardust 'ecosystem'.
